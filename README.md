# ChooseYourOwnAdventureSite
This is a little game that I made for my wedding guests.
It was inspired by Ernest Cline's Ready Player One's Easter Egg Hunt that he implemeneted inside of his book.

In a similar fashion, whichever one of my wedding guests found this website and successfully found the "treasure" hidden within the game, then I gave them a real life prize at the wedding.

The game is quite tedious. If you'd like to check it, it is deployed through this repository's GitHub Pages website.
