# Choose Your Own Adventure Site
This is a little game that I made for my wedding guests.
It was inspired by Ernest Cline's Ready Player One's Easter Egg Hunt that he implemeneted inside of his book.

In a similar fashion, the first wedding guest to find this website through convolunted hints on the wedding website and successfully find the "treasure" hidden within the game won a prize at my wedding.

The game is more like a maze, then a choose your own adventure. If you'd like to check it out, it is deployed through this repository's GitHub Pages website.
